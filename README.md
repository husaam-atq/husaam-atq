# Hi, I'm Husaam ðŸ‘‹  
- MSc Data Science & Artificial Intelligence @ Queen Mary University of London.  
- Time-qualified Chartered Accountant (ICAS).  
- Interested in Quantitative Finance, Portfolio Analytics, Private Equity & Machine Learning.  

## About Me
- Previously worked in Financial Services Audit at EY, covering insurance, broking, wealth & asset management, and banking clients.  
- Now developing advanced data and quantitative skills through Python, statistics, and machine learning.  
- Exploring how data-driven models can enhance portfolio optimisation, risk management, and trading strategies.

## Selected Quantitative Projects  

### 1. Moving Average Crossover Backtest  
Developed a Python-based backtesting framework to compare a 20/50-day moving average strategy against a buy-and-hold benchmark.  
- Calculated daily returns and cumulative strategy performance.  
- Visualised crossover signals and portfolio equity curves.  
- Tools: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib.  

### 2. Monte Carlo Stock Price Simulation  
Implemented Monte Carlo simulations to model potential stock price paths over a trading year.  
- Simulated stochastic processes with random drift and volatility.  
- Analysed expected value and variance of returns.  
- Tools: NumPy, matplotlib.  

### 3. Value-at-Risk (VaR) Calculator  
Built a risk analytics tool to estimate portfolio VaR using both historical and parametric methods.  
- Plotted daily returns distributions with confidence thresholds.  
- Compared model accuracy and tail risk estimations.  
- Tools: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, SciPy.  

### 4. Statistics Coursework 1 & 2  
Conducted data exploration, regression, and residual analysis using real-world datasets.  
- Evaluated correlation, model fit, and hypothesis testing.  
- Developed and validated predictive regression models in Python.  

### 5. Ongoing Development: Programming Coursework (Text & Data Analysis)
Currently working on small programming challenges and exploratory quant-finance exercises to deepen understanding of algorithmic modelling and data-driven investment analysis.
Exploring further Python fundamentals through text mining and data manipulation tasks.  
- Implemented anagram detection and Jaccard similarity algorithms.  
- Parsed JSON-based datasets (Wikipedia/Twitter) for frequency analysis.
